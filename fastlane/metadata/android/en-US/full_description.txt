Subhub is a small lightweight subtitles app downloader that’ll provide you with a modern UI and easy to use interface.

Download multi-language subtitles for all your favorite movies, shows and sitcoms. Automatically scans your device and presents available subtitle files for you to choose from.

You can manually search for a movie subtitle even if you don’t have it on your device, the app provides you with an easy navigation interface that is simple enough.

In settings, you can set your preferred download location and language so that every time you search for a subtitle it’ll automatically fill in these fields and you just have to provide the name of the movie/video/tv show or by simply clicking on one video from your storage it’ll fill everything.

Beware that all the content is provided by opensubtitles so in case you can’t find a subtitle for your search, contact their site.
